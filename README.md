## Inspiration and Credits

This project is a Rust reimplementation inspired by the [OpenAI Realtime Agents Demo](https://github.com/openai/openai-realtime-agents). The original project, created by [Noah MacCallum](https://x.com/noahmacca)] and [Ilan Bigio](https://github.com/ibigio), demonstrates advanced agentic patterns built on top of a Realtime API.
My version is designed with plans to later become a [Tinker](https://github.com/DanEdens/Tinker) module.
Much of the theming ideas stem from [J.S. Morin's Twinborn and Black Ocean universes](https://www.jsmorin.com/)

## Setup

### Prerequisites
- Rust toolchain (latest stable)
- LM Studio running locally (default: http://127.0.0.1:1234)
- Git (for version control features)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies with `cargo build`
3. Start LM Studio with the Qwen model
4. Run tests with `cargo test`
5. Start the server with `cargo run`
6. The server will start on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### Docker Deployment
We provide Docker support for easy deployment on any platform:

```bash
# Check if local Ollama is running and start services
./run_services.sh

# Alternatively, on macOS/Linux:
./docker-setup.sh

# On Windows (using PowerShell):
.\docker-setup.ps1
```

This will start:
- The Swarmonomicon API server on port 3000
- MongoDB for data storage
- Mosquitto MQTT broker for messaging

The system is configured to use your local Ollama instance (must be running at http://localhost:11434) via host.docker.internal. This allows you to maintain your models outside the Docker environment.

For detailed Docker deployment instructions, see [DOCKER.md](DOCKER.md).

### Cross-Compilation for EC2 Deployment
We provide tools for cross-compiling the project on your local machine and deploying it to an EC2 instance:

## Features

- Agent-based architecture for modular task handling
- Tool registry for extensible functionality
- State machine support for complex workflows
- WebSocket API for real-time communication
- CLI interface for common operations

### Git Operations

The framework includes a Git assistant agent that can be used via CLI:

```bash
# Auto-generate commit message
swarm git

# Commit with specific message
swarm git -m "feat: add new feature"

# Create and switch to new branch
swarm git -b feature/new-branch

# Merge current branch into target
swarm git -t main
```

The Git assistant uses AI to generate meaningful commit messages based on the changes in your working directory.

## API Endpoints

### Agent Management
- `GET /api/agents` - List all available agents
- `GET /api/agents/:name` - Get details about a specific agent
- `POST /api/agents/:name/message` - Send a message to an agent
- `POST /api/agents/:name/send` - Send a command to an agent

### Task Management
- `GET /api/agents/:name/tasks` - Get all tasks for an agent
- `POST /api/agents/:name/tasks` - Add a task to an agent's todo list
- `GET /api/agents/:name/tasks/:task_id` - Get details about a specific task

### WebSocket
- `GET /ws` - WebSocket endpoint for real-time communication

## Task System

The system uses a sophisticated task management system with AI enhancement capabilities:

#### Task Priority Levels
- Critical: Highest priority tasks that need immediate attention
- High: Important tasks that should be processed soon
- Medium: Regular priority tasks
- Low: Background tasks that can wait

#### Task Status Flow
1. Pending: Task has been added to the todo list
2. InProgress: Task is currently being processed
3. Completed: Task has been successfully completed
4. Failed: Task processing failed

#### Task Structure
```rust
pub struct TodoTask {
    pub id: String,
    pub description: String,
    pub enhanced_description: Option<String>,
    pub priority: TaskPriority,
    pub source_agent: Option<String>,
    pub target_agent: String,
    pub status: TaskStatus,
    pub created_at: i64,
    pub completed_at: Option<i64>,
}
```

#### AI Enhancement System

The system implements a layered approach to AI task enhancement:

1. Infrastructure Layer (API/Worker):
   - Handles basic task creation and routing
   - No AI enhancement at this level
   - Preserves original task descriptions

2. Agent Layer:
   - Implements AI enhancement during task processing
   - Adds technical details and context
   - Maintains task integrity

3. Storage Layer:
   - MongoDB-based persistent storage
   - Configurable database via RTK_MONGO_DB
   - Stores both original and enhanced descriptions

#### Task Creation

Tasks can be created through multiple channels:
1. API endpoints
2. MQTT messages
3. Agent-to-agent delegation

Example API request:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/agents/greeter/tasks \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "description": "Welcome new user John",
    "priority": "High",
    "source_agent": null
  }'
```

Response:
```json
{
  "id": "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000",
  "description": "Welcome new user John",
  "enhanced_description": null,
  "priority": "High",
  "source_agent": null,
  "target_agent": "greeter",
  "status": "Pending",
  "created_at": 1677721600,
  "completed_at": null
}
```

The task will be enhanced during processing by the target agent, adding technical details and context while preserving the original description.

#### Enhanced Todo Worker

The todo_worker has been significantly improved with the following features:

1. **Robust Error Handling**
   - Graceful recovery from MQTT connection issues
   - Automatic reconnection with configurable retry limits
   - Detailed error reporting via MQTT topics
   - Timeout detection for stalled task processing

2. **Advanced Metrics Collection**
   - Success rate tracking and health status monitoring
   - Priority-based metrics (tracking of Critical/High/Medium/Low tasks)
   - Processing time measurements for performance analysis
   - Timeout detection and reporting
   - Periodic metrics publishing to MQTT topics

3. **Health Monitoring**
   - Live health status publishing (`health/todo_worker` topic)
   - Configurable health thresholds based on success rate
   - Detailed diagnostic information for troubleshooting

4. **Task Prioritization**
   - Efficient task processing based on priority
   - Detailed tracking of tasks by priority levels
   - Performance metrics for each priority level

5. **Control Interface**
   - Remote status checking via MQTT commands
   - Control commands for runtime configuration
   - Synchronous and asynchronous processing models

Example metrics output (published to `metrics/todo_worker`):
```json
{
  "tasks_processed": 127,
  "tasks_succeeded": 120,
  "tasks_failed": 5,
  "tasks_timeout": 2,
  "success_rate": 94.49,
  "uptime_seconds": 3600,
  "critical_tasks_processed": 10,
  "high_tasks_processed": 32,
  "medium_tasks_processed": 55,
  "low_tasks_processed": 30,
  "healthy": true,
  "timestamp": "2023-04-11T15:30:45Z"
}
```

The worker can be controlled remotely by publishing commands to the `todo_worker/control` topic:
```json
{"command": "status"}
```

Response (published to `todo_worker/status`):
```json
{
  "tasks_processed": 127,
  "tasks_succeeded": 120,
  "tasks_failed": 5,
  "tasks_timeout": 2,
  "success_rate": 94.49,
  "uptime_seconds": 3600,
  "healthy": true,
  "timestamp": "2023-04-11T15:30:45Z"
}
```

## Usage

### Starting the Server
```bash
cargo run --bin swarm
```

### Adding a Task via API
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/agents/greeter/tasks \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "description": "Welcome new user John",
    "priority": "High",
    "source_agent": null
  }'
```

The response will include both the original and AI-enhanced descriptions:
```json
{
  "id": "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000",
  "description": "Welcome new user John",
  "enhanced_description": "Initiate personalized welcome sequence for new user John, including system introduction and available agent overview. Ensure proper onboarding experience and gather initial user preferences for future interactions.",
  "priority": "High",
  "source_agent": null,
  "target_agent": "greeter",
  "status": "Pending",
  "created_at": 1677721600,
  "completed_at": null
}
```

```

## Development

### Prerequisites
- Rust 1.70 or higher
- Cargo
- Optional: Chrome/Chromium (for browser automation features)

### Building
```bash
cargo build
```

### Running Tests

## Architecture

The system uses a modular architecture where each agent is an independent entity that can:
1. Process messages directly
2. Handle tasks asynchronously
3. Delegate work to other agents
4. Maintain its own state and todo list

Each agent runs in its own async task, processing its todo list at configurable intervals. This allows for true parallel processing and independent operation.

## MCP Topic Routing

Added support for subscribing to `mcp/*` topics in the MCP Todo Server and routing todos to the appropriate target agent based on the topic path.

Changes made:
- Updated the MQTT subscription in `mqtt_intake.rs` from `mcp/todo` to `mcp/*` to subscribe to all mcp topics
- Parse the topic path from received messages and pass it to the `TodoTool.add_todo()` method as the `target_agent` parameter
- Modified the `TodoTool.add_todo()` method to accept a `target_agent` parameter and use it when creating new `TodoTask` instances
- Fixed a "temporary value dropped while borrowed" error in `todo.rs` by assigning the default `target_agent` value to a variable before using it in `unwrap_or()`

These changes allow for more flexible routing of todos based on the MQTT topic they are published to. The target agent can be determined from the topic path.

## Reinforcement Learning System

The framework includes a reinforcement learning system with the following features:

### Core Components
- Flexible agent, state, and environment abstractions
- Q-learning implementation with configurable parameters
- Model serialization and deserialization
- Training configuration system
- Performance visualization tools
- Training metrics collection

### Flappy Bird Example
A complete implementation of Flappy Bird as a reinforcement learning environment:

```bash
# Train a Flappy Bird agent (no visualization)
cargo run --bin train_flappy --features rl

# Train with visualization
cargo run --bin train_flappy --features rl -- -v

# Train with custom configuration
cargo run --bin train_flappy --features rl -- -c config.json -m metrics/

# Use a trained model
cargo run --bin train_flappy --features rl -- -m path/to/model.json
```

### Training Configuration
The training configuration system allows for easy experimentation with different hyperparameters:

```json
{
  "learning_rate": 0.1,
  "discount_factor": 0.95,
  "epsilon": 0.1,
  "epsilon_decay": 0.999,
  "min_epsilon": 0.01,
  "episodes": 1000,
  "visualize": false,
  "checkpoint_freq": 100,
  "checkpoint_path": "models",
  "save_metrics": true,
  "metrics_path": "metrics"
}
```

### Visualization Tools
The framework includes tools for visualizing training progress:
- Real-time reward, score, and epsilon plots
- HTML training reports with key metrics
- Training history serialization for further analysis

### Extensibility
The RL system is designed to be easily extended:
- Implement the `State` and `Action` traits for new environments
- Create custom environment implementations by implementing the `Environment` trait
- Add new agent algorithms by extending the architecture

### MQTT Topic Structure

The system uses MQTT for internal communication between components with a carefully designed topic structure to prevent recursive message loops:

- `mcp/+` - Topics for incoming MCP commands to be processed
- `response/+/todo` - Response topics for successful todo processing
- `response/+/error` - Error response topics
- `response/mcp_server/status` - Server status response topic
- `metrics/response/mqtt_intake` - Metrics reporting topic

The separation between command topics (mcp/) and response topics (response/) prevents the system from processing its own response messages and creating unwanted recursion.

#### QoS Settings

All MQTT communications use QoS 2 (ExactlyOnce) to ensure:
- Messages are delivered exactly once
- No duplicate message processing occurs
- System reliability is maintained

This is especially important for the todo processing system where duplicate messages could create redundant tasks.
